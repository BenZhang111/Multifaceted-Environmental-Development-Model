# Multifaceted-Environmental-Development-Model
The Multifaceted Environmental Development Model (MEDM) is a comprehensive climate–economic framework designed to evaluate long-term development strategies under environmental constraints. The model projects up to 150 years into the future, with detailed outputs emphasized over the first 80 years to align with policy-relevant horizons.

Building on Nordhaus’ Dynamic Integrated Climate–Economy (DICE) model, the MEDM extends the standard framework by adding air pollution damages: an explicit damage function captures the health and productivity costs of local pollutants, complementing the long-run impacts of climate change. Moreover, an endogenous population growth is modeled as a function of income and environmental stress, allowing feedback between demographic change, economic development, and environmental quality.

Together, these features allow the MEDM to simulate a broad range of policy pathways—such as carbon taxation, clean technology investment, adaptation, and carbon removal—and to compare their implications for economic output, emissions, population, and welfare.
